## Overview
Most people have a need to keep track of their everyday tasks in an organized manner. As graduate students and command line aficionados, we're all about efficiency and simplicity. That's why we're taking on the challenge of developing a command line based To-Do List application using Haskell, with a special focus on the Brick library for that slick user interface. Our aim of this project is to deliver a user-friendly interface and some cool features. The following features and timeline are projected and expected. 

## Progress at Dec 1
We finished the following tasks:  
- User Interface (UI) Development: The user interface has been defined and implemented, ensuring that users can interact effectively with the system. 
- Data Structure Implementation: A robust data structure has been created to store and index tasks. This structure is crucial for efficiently organizing, retrieving, and managing the tasks within the system, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience.
- Task Prioritization System: A system has been developed to prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. This feature allows for better management of tasks, ensuring that the most critical and time-sensitive tasks are addressed first.
- Task Addition Functionality: The functionality for adding new tasks has been implemented.
  
## Updated Milestones
### Milestone 2 (Week 10): Task Deletion, Modification and Sorting  
  - Edit Tasks: Facilitate modifications to the existing tasks.   
  - Delete Tasks: Provide the option to remove tasks that are no longer needed.   
  - Sorting Options: Allow tasks to be sorted based on their priority, due date, or other criteria.  

### Milestone 3 (Week 11): Data Export and Import  
- Objective: Provide flexibility in data management.  
- Features:  
  - Data Export: Allow users to export their to-do list for backup purposes.  
  - Data Import: Enable importing to-do lists from privious backups to ease the data transfer process.

### Milestone 4 (If Time Allows): Synchronization and Accessibility  
- Objective: Ensure data is accessible across multiple devices.  
- Features:  
  - Syncing: Implement a synchronization mechanism to allow task data to be consistent across different devices.  
  - Cross-Device Accessibility: Enable users to access their to-do list from various devices seamlessly.  

## Original Projected Milestones (Deprecated)
### Milestone 1 (Week 8 - 9): Task Creation and Management
- Objective: Implement basic task management functionalities.  
- Features:  
  - Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks with essential details like title, description, and due date.
